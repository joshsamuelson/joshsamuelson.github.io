    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Things have changed quite a bit for me in the last year and I&rsquo;ve been feeling
the urge to start blogging again. Since my previous blog a bit of a mess and the
content was all over the map, I decided to start fresh and keep the content more
focused. This time I&rsquo;m going to focus on projects, mostly tech projects, but
maybe I&rsquo;ll throw in the occasional cooking or brewing adventure.</p>

<p>The other reason for the reboot is that I&rsquo;m sick of dealing with Wordpress&#8217;
nonsense, most recently it was alerting me to an update and wasn&rsquo;t letting me
update. Rather than deal with the pain of fixing it by hand, and possibly
redeploying and restoring I thought I&rsquo;d just give octopress a try.</p>

<p>My plan is to move this into S3 eventually but for now I&rsquo;m just using the
built-in github pages. I like the idea of replacing a heavy slow platform like
wordpress with something totally static in S3. Once that&rsquo;s done, I may even
transfer my domain over to Amazon too and just get rid of my old hosting provider.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll probably recycle some of my old blog, but some of it I&rsquo;ll leave behind,
for now I&rsquo;m just going to focus on new content.</p>
