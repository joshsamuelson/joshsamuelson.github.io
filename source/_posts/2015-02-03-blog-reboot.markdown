Things have changed quite a bit for me in the last year and I've been feeling the urge to start blogging again. Since my previous blog a bit of a mess and the content was all over the map, I decided to start fresh and keep the content more focused. This time I'm going to focus on projects, mostly tech projects, but maybe I'll throw in the occasional cooking or brewing adventure.

The other reason for the reboot is that I'm sick of dealing with Wordpress' nonsense, most recently it was alerting me to an update and wasn't letting me update. Rather than deal with the pain of fixing it by hand, and possibly redeploying and restoring I thought I'd just give octopress a try.

My plan is to move this into S3 eventually but for now I'm just using the built-in github pages. I like the idea of replacing a heavy slow platform like wordpress with something totally static in S3. Once that's done, I may even transfer my domain over to Amazon too and just get rid of my old hosting provider.

I'll probably recycle some of my old blog, but some of it I'll leave behind, for now I'm just going to focus on new content.
