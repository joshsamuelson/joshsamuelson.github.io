I started using computers when I was four years old and my parents bought an
IBM PC Jr. They were so convinced that computers were the wave of the future
that they started a computer store, selling Amigas. I learned to code on an
Apple II in BASIC, and got to learn logo, and then C, and then C++, and then
Visual BASIC, Assembly, and then Java... and then I gave it up for a few years
until I discovered python and ruby. Mostly I've realized that the language
doesn't matter that much, but the concepts transfer pretty well.

I like learning new things, cooking, brewing/drinking beer, and playing with
computers. I work for Puppet Labs in PDX, making tools to help people learn
puppet. In the past, I've been a cook at a Holden Village, a pastor in North
Hollywood, a sysadmin at a few places, a student in Berekely, a test technician
at Intel, and a few other things.
